        Hey HoneyCoin — I’m Sean. I rebuilt your currency converter because details matter.
      </h1>

      <!-- <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed">
        When I tried the converter on your site, switching currencies and auto-updating amounts felt
        a bit sticky. Small friction in a money tool chips away at trust, so I built this snappy
        version: type, tab, flip — it responds instantly. It also uses your open
        <span class="font-mono">/utilities/rates</span>
        endpoint (no secrets). This is how I work: ship something real, polish the edges, earn the
        user’s confidence.
      </p> -->

      <!-- TL;DR -->
      <div
        class="rounded-xl bg-neutral-100/50 border border-amber-600 p-4 text-sm text-neutral-800"
      >
        <div><strong>TL;DR:</strong></div>
        The converter on your site looked fine but felt slow. I rebuilt it with Angular 20 +
        Tailwind so every interaction — typing, swapping currencies, updating amounts — feels
        instant and trustworthy. This is the kind of care I bring to everything I build.
      </div>

      <div class="md:w-3/4">
        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed mb-2">
          So, picture this, I open your site, type a number into the currency converter, flip the
          currencies… and nothing happens straight away. There’s that little pause where you wonder,
          “did it work?” It’s tiny, but with money tools, those moments matter. Smoothness isn’t
          just UX, it’s trust.
        </p>

        <p class="text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed">
          Your public FX endpoint is fast enough to feel instant (or not slow), it just wasn’t being
          used that way. So I built the version I wish I had seen: type, tab, flip and the numbers
          respond immediately. No reloads, no waiting, no second guesses.
        </p>

          This work fits me because I’m already in these trenches. At
          <span class="font-medium text-orange-400">Hamwe</span>, I’m building a CRM for East
          African SMEs where internet access is patchy, budgets are tight, and speed isn’t a “nice
          to have” — it’s the difference between a business using our product or churning the same
          day. I design endpoints that respond fast, cache data aggressively with Redis, and ensure
          every click feels instant even on shaky 3G connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <span class="font-medium text-violet-400">Sweep</span>, I wired real-time price feeds
          into reactive UIs — so when markets moved, our users saw updates immediately. That meant
          learning how to debounce requests, handle WebSocket drops gracefully, and design APIs that
          didn’t crumble when data spiked.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <span class="font-medium text-emerald-400">Artemis</span>, the challenge was helping
          micro-businesses make decisions faster. I worked on APIs that had to aggregate messy
          financial data, normalize it, and serve it back cleanly — because if a small shop owner
          can’t trust the numbers, the whole product loses value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, at <span class="font-medium text-amber-400">Matrix</span> and
          <span class="font-medium text-indigo-400">Beannsofts</span>, I obsessed over reliability
          and polish. I learned how to build cron jobs on GCP that didn’t silently fail, structured
          Firestore data for scale, and shipped frontend experiences in Angular that felt
          predictable even under load.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I see your stack — Node/TypeScript, Redis, Firestore, Angular, I am seeing the same
          tools that I use to solve real-world problems day after day.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I want to bring to HoneyCoin is that same mix of steady backend engineering and real
          product empathy. You know, the kind that shows up in small but meaningful ways. Like a
          converter that never stutters, like payout flows that always feel predictable, and little
          touches that quietly tell your users, “we’ve got you,” whether they’re moving $10 or
          $10,000 across borders.

        If this feels like the kind of care you want on your backend & product surfaces, I’d love to
        chat. I can walk through cache strategies, cron workflows, and the “boring” reliability that
        keeps ambitious rails like yours trustworthy.
